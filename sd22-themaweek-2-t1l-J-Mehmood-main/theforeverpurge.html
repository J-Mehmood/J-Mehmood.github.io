    <p class="p11"><i>In 2048, eight years after Charlene Roan's presidential election, the New Founding Fathers of
            America (NFFA) have regained control of the U.S. government and have re-instituted the annual Purge with its
            original rules. Racial supremacy and nativism have surged nationwide following their re-election, and many
            outside the ruling party are concerned that the upcoming Purge will inflict more damage on the country than
            the NFFA realizes. Married migrant couple Juan and Adela illegally cross the border into Texas to escape
            from a Mexican drug cartel and build a new life, with Juan working as a farmhand on the Tucker family ranch
            while Adela begins working near Austin.

            Ten months later, on the eve of the next annual Purge, Juan and Adela join a migrant community behind a
            walled sanctuary with armed security to protect them. As the Purge begins, Adela witnesses a nationalist
            Purger group, who declare themselves to be a "Purge Purification Force" (PPF) that intend to kill those
            people that they consider non-American. The group passes by without hostility, and the migrant community
            survives the Purge with no incidents. Come morning, Juan and Adela return to their jobs, but both notice
            that many of their co-workers did not report to work. Shortly after, Adela is attacked by two Purgers but
            she is rescued by her boss Darius before both are arrested by police for killing their attackers.</i></p>
